# Ghadi - A 3D Watch Visualizer with Augmented Reality

## Introduction

**Ghadi** is an advanced 3D Watch Customization application designed to enhance the online shopping experience by allowing users to personalize wristwatches before making a purchase. Built using **Unity**, this interactive platform provides an extensive collection of 3D watch models, offering users the ability to customize various aspects such as **dial design, strap material, and case finish**. 

One of the standout features of this project is **Augmented Reality (AR) integration**, allowing users to visualize their customized watches in real-world settings through their device cameras. By superimposing the virtual watch onto their wrists, users can preview the timepiece in real-time, gaining confidence in their purchase decisions.

## Architecture

The application follows a streamlined workflow to ensure seamless user interaction:

1. **Launching the Application** - The user opens the Unity-based application.
2. **Loading Customization Data** - The app retrieves material and color data of the 3D watch models.
3. **Customizing the Watch** - The user can use the **"Customizer"** to modify the appearance of the watch in real-time.
4. **Interacting with the AR Scene** - The user can tap the **"View in AR"** button to enter the AR scene.
5. **Activating AR Mode** - Unity initializes the AR session and superimposes the customized 3D watch onto the user's wrist.



## Software Requirements

The following software tools and libraries were used to develop and enhance **Ghadi**:

- **Unity** - Primary development environment for 3D modeling, customization UI, and AR rendering.
- **Vuforia SDK** - Enables AR capabilities within Unity, allowing real-world visualization of the customized watches.
- **Blender** - Used to create and refine high-quality 3D watch models.

Each of these tools plays a crucial role in ensuring a **smooth, realistic, and interactive experience** for users.

## Results

The **Ghadi** project successfully implemented both the **customizer** and **AR viewer** functionalities, delivering an immersive and seamless user experience. The key outcomes of the project include:

- **Dynamic Watch Customization:** Users can modify various watch attributes (color, texture, design) through an intuitive interface.
- **Interactive UI:** The Unity-based UI allows effortless navigation between customization and AR viewing.
- **Realistic AR Visualization:** The AR viewer provides an accurate representation of customized watches in different environments.
- **Optimized Performance:** The application ensures **smooth rendering and minimal lag**, creating a fluid user experience.
